# Intelligent-Skin-Cancer-Screening

Skin cancer, the most common form of cancer globally, arises from abnormal skin cell growth. It includes basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Early detection through self-examination and professional screenings is crucial for effective treatment. 
Our goal in this project is to assess the effectiveness and precision of various CNN models for classifying suspicious changes on skin into several disease categories. We seek to provide a reliable and efficient method for early detection of skin cancer.
